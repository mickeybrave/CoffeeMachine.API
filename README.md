# Important notes:
## Security Key

I decided to keep it in configuration directly to reduce compelxity.
I real development we'd keep it in Azure Vault or Envronment Variable, but both options problematic when someone else will run it.

## Unit and Integration tests

I implemented both. Some may test the same behavior, but wanted to show that we can test different ways.
